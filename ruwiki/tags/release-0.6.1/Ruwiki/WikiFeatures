Ruwiki is a [http://www.ruby-lang.org Ruby]-based wiki. It is ideal for
personal or small team use.

Ruwiki:
* Uses the [http://www.ruby-lang.org Ruby] language.
* Runs quickly and easily as a CGI or WEBrick servlet.
* Uses a simple templating system and CSS for presentation.
* Has flatfile storage with simple versioning.
* Offers project namespaces. Different projects can have the same topic names and not collide. Thus, \Default::ReadMe and \Project::ReadMe are two different pages.
